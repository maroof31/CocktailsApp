## Features

### 1. MVVM Clean Architecture

The app is structured based on the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) clean architecture, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability. This architecture ensures a clear distinction between the data layer, business logic, and UI components.

### Jetpack Compose
- **Declarative UI**: Jetpack Compose enables you to describe the UI in a more concise and intuitive manner, reducing UI-related bugs and improving code readability.
- **Reusable Components**: Compose encourages the creation of reusable UI components, promoting a modular and maintainable codebase.
- **Consistency**: The Material Library offers pre-designed UI elements and guidelines, ensuring a consistent and visually pleasing user interface.

### 2. Hilt Dependency Injection

Hilt is used for dependency injection, simplifying the management of dependencies and promoting code reusability. With Hilt, the app benefits from a modular and organized structure, making it easy to maintain and extend.

### 3. Retrofit for Networking

Retrofit is employed for handling network requests and interactions with a backend server. It enables the app to efficiently retrieve cocktail data, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

### 4. Coil for Image Loading

Coil is utilized for image loading, providing fast and memory-efficient image loading capabilities. This ensures that cocktail images are loaded seamlessly, enhancing the visual appeal of the app.
